    <h1>What is the Super Mario RPG: Gentle Beauty and Raw Power Randomizer?</h1>
    <div class="well">
        <p>A program that shuffles around a bunch of stuff in Super Mario RPG! Major things like the story progression
            and actual areas remain the same, but lots of stat and item-related stuff is shuffled around. It's a
            different experience every time! For the full list of what can be shuffled, see the Help section above.</p>
        <p>The original command line version up to V4 was written by <a href="https://github.com/abyssonym"
                                                                        target="_blank">abyssonym</a>.
            Without his work, none of this would have been possible! Check out his GitHub page for more randomizer work.
            This new web version was written and is maintained by <a href="https://github.com/DorkmasterFlek"
