    <h1>What is the Super Mario RPG: Gentle Beauty and Raw Power Randomizer?</h1>
    <div class="well">
        <p>A program that shuffles around a bunch of stuff in Super Mario RPG! Major things like the story progression
            and actual areas remain the same, but lots of stat and item-related stuff is shuffled around. It's a
            different experience every time! For the full list of what can be shuffled, see the Help section above.</p>
        <p>This program wouldn't have been possible without the work of several people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abyssonym" target="_blank">abyssonym</a> for making the
                original command line version of the randomizer up to V4 and letting us adapt it into this new form!
                Check out his GitHub page for more randomizer work!
            </li>
            <li>Huge thanks to Alanim for creating the cutscene skip modifications and helping with ROM hacking
                knowledge in adding new features!
            </li>
            <li>This new web version was written and is maintained by

            </li>
            <li>Shoutouts to Veetorp and the <a href="http://alttpr.com/" target="_blank">Link to the Past
                randomizer</a> community for their excellent work on web-based ROM patching, which we totally stole a
                bunch of good ideas from!
            </li>
        </ul>
