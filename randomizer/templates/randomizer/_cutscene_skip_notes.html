<p><strong>* NOTE:</strong> The cutscene skip patch is experimental. There is currently a known softlock issue if you
    attempt to start the cutscene at the Mushroom Kingdom throne room after bringing Peach back from Marrymore.
    <strong>Do not</strong> proceed to this cutscene after the Bundt fight! Simply proceed to Tadpole Pond and talk to
    Frogfucius to unlock Star Hill.
