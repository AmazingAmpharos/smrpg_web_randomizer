                and provide your ROM.</p>
            <p>If you're not familiar with the randomizer, you should check out the
                <a href="{% url 'randomizer:resources' %}">Resources</a> page for some important info!</p>
            <p>Once you've got a randomized ROM, you need a way to play. There's a couple

            <h3 class="card-title">Option 1: Use an Emulator</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>An emulator is a program that closely replicates SNES hardware, allowing you to run SNES games on
                your computer. Our recommended emulator is Snes9x as it's the easiest to use. You can find it on
                their website <a href="http://www.snes9x.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Another good emulator you might want to use is bsnes/higan. This is more complicated to set up, but
                bsnes/higan is very accurate, and the higan project supports multiple systems. You can find it on
                their website <a href="https://byuu.org/emulation/higan/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>While you can play using only your keyboard, a controller makes for a better experience. While most
                USB controllers will work, the most recommended ones include the
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B9XB0E" target="_blank">iBuffalo Classic USB Gamepad</a> or
                the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y0LUQFE" target="_blank">8Bitdo SFC30 Wireless Bluetooth
                    Controller</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Option 2: Play on Original Hardware (BETA)</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Yes, you read that right! You can actually play this on your original SNES console now. Playing a
                randomizer on original hardware requires a "flash cart", which is a special cartridge designed for that
                hardware that allows you to put the randomized ROM on some kind of portable flash memory (usually an SD
                or MicroSD card) which is inserted into the flash cart, which then goes in the original console.</p>
            <p>The best SNES flash cart on the market right now (and the only one that currently supports Super Mario
                RPG) is the SD2SNES.  You can learn more about it, download the firmware, and find a shop to buy one on
                their website <a href="https://sd2snes.de/blog/about" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Until very recently, no SNES flash cart on the market (including the SD2SNES) supported the SA-1
                enhancement chip that SMRPG uses.  However thanks to the insane work of
                <a href="https://github.com/RedGuyyyy/" target="_blank">RedGuy</a>, SA-1 support is being added to the
                firmware!  This firmware is unofficial and currently in public beta.  However it appears to be mostly
                complete and running very well so far, and RedGuy is making fast progress with new releases.</p>
            <p>In order to use this firmware, you need a clean install of the current official SD2SNES firmware
                downloaded from the official website above.  Once you have this, you can download the current public
                beta from RedGuy's GitHub page
                <a href="https://github.com/RedGuyyyy/sd2snes/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Option 3: Play on Wii Virtual Console</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>If you don't have an SD2SNES and don't want to play on emulator, it is possible to play this on the Wii
                Virtual Console.  Prior to RedGuy's recent work, this was the preferred way to play as close to original
                hardware as possible.  This requires locating a WAD file of the North American release of SMRPG on the
                Wii VC.  The randomizer can pack the generated ROM into the WAD file for you automatically.</p>
            <p>Once you have the packed WAD file, you can install it on your Wii using the Homebrew Channel.  Setting
                this up is beyong the scope of this site, but we do have some instructions on the community wiki that
                can be found
