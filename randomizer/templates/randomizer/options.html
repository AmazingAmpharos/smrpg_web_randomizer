                <p>This is the default full shuffle mode. This is the most common mode when we race, and it's the same
                    as doing a custom mode with all the flags enabled. See the next section for a description of
                    flags.</p>
                <h4>Custom</h4>
                <p>This mode lets you pick and choose exactly what flags you want to use. The available flags are as
                    follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    {% for flag in flags %}
                        <li>{{ flag.1 }} - {{ flag.2 }}</li>

                <p>Seed is a number used to randomize the game. If you want to generate the same game as somebody else
                    for racing, you can enter an exact seed here. If you just want a fresh experience, leave this blank
                    and the site will generate it automatically.</p>

                    <li>The maximum number of coins you can hold is increased to 9999.</li>

                <h4>Cutscene Skip</h4>
                <p>The randomizer applies a patch which skips most of the cutscenes and text in the game. This patch
                    only works on the US or EU version, since the EU version is based on the US one. Only these regions
                    are supported as a result.</p>
